This is a powerful program that is cross-platform that uses AI to be a vector editor. It contains all the standard tools of editing vectors and PNGs and stuff like that. It uses the Webstack including ViewJS, but it has rust in it so that it is able to do all manipulations and computations in a rust back end and then it paints to a canvas. So the buttons and stuff like that run on top of the canvas in regular ViewJS or HTML however you want to do it. But the actual computations run in a rust web assembly back end. Your job is to make this thing work but also be AI assisted so integral to it will be an AI chat panel where people can chat. And there will be a built-in large language model that you will use and that large language model will have a system prompt that you will create and that system prompt to give us JSON commands that can be done. So in the prompt you provide it with the different objects that are there and their positions and stuff like that and then what it can output is it can output commands. So for example someone could say make these two objects touch each other based on the information given it it could return like a move object command and the idea of the object and the X and Y so it makes the two objects flush. So a small language model like IBM granite or something like that that can handle this. But yeah that's the goal. So your job is to build a web assembly backed engine for rendering and then we have a view JS UI on top of it so that it can all be in a web app or electron. So I'd like to have both compile targets of electron for desktop and web app. It also needs to be able to open up regular image files and do basic editing like cropping as well and you have to have the ability to put images inside the vector as well. Thanks, that's it.
